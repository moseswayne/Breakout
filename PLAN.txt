Project: Breakout Game

Plan:

Variant of Breakout that I found interesting:
I found the "Worms" variant of Breakout to be the most interesting because of 
all of the different power up mechanics. I found that the power ups to the game
added a certain depth to Breakout by making it much more interesting while 
still staying true to the core mechanics of Breakout. There is a lot of 
flexibility in the direction in which to take Breakout in adding power ups to 
the game both in terms of differing functionality and playability because of
the vast number of possible power ups to use. I also thought that the falling
power up containers was a nice touch in the game. 
I also found the "Vortex" variant of breakout to be interesting in that the 
game's mechanic for movement is very different from all of the other variants 
of Breakout. Since the bar for the game rotates in a circle, there are no 
bounds for its movement, and it is able to hit the ball from any side. I found
this mechanic of the game to be interesting. 

Plan for development of the Breakout game:
My intention for this game of Breakout is to make a variant of Breakout that 
stays true to the main component of Breakout while adding elements to make the
game significantly more challenging and entertaining. This would add elements
like both a top and bottom bar to the game and other elements like bricks (the 
blocks in the game) reappearing after some event.

Levels:
Different levels of game will have different block layouts with higher levels 
having blocks that are more difficult to break.
