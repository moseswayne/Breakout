Run Breakout.java to initiate the game.

A simple game of Breakout using JavaFX. 
There are 5 powerups, but they all use the same icon. Bricks that drop powerups
are yellow. The three different kinds of bricks are single hit, multi hit, and 
ones that drop various powerups. The paddle has multiple abilities as well. 
Powerups can extend the paddle temporarily, make the bouncers stick to the paddle 
for a fixed amount of time, and angles for how the balls bounce are calculated 
based on where on the paddle they hit, allowing for all possible areas of the 
screen to be hit. Levels are read in from a file reader and they can be added into
the game by adding text files of bricks into the datafiles folder.

Note: In its current version, the game does not include a splash screen.
